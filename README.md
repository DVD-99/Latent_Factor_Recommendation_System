# Latent_Factor_Recommendation_Systems
A Latent Factor Recommendation system which we can use it to recommend movies to users.
It is a simple Implementation of Recommendation systems. I have used PySpark, as the data is going to be very huge it would be easy to process the data in parallel across a cluster.
The dataset ratings.csv has around 609 users and 9485 movies.
