# Latent Factor Recommendation Systems
A Latent Factor Recommendation system which we can use it to recommend movies to users.
It is a simple Implementation of Recommendation systems. I using PySpark would be a good idea, as the data is going to be very huge it would be easy to process the data in parallel across a cluster.
The dataset ratings.csv has around 609 users and 9485 movies. As you can see it is a small dataset I have used numpy.
